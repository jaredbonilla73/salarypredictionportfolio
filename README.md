## Exploratory Data Analysis
-Visually Summarize Data.
- Identify patterns and trends and outliers.
- Look for correlations among features and target.

## Clean Data & Feature Engineer:
- Remove data where salary = 0
- Create feature for mean of each categorical category
- encode data and prepare for model fitting

## Baseline Model/Metric:
- Cross validate among three baseline models
- Baseline Metric= Mean Squared Error

## Evaluate Results:
- Choose model with lowest mean squared error
- Fit training data
- Predict testing data
- Generate feature importance
